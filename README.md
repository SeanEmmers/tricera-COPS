## What was Our Motivation?

We were tasked with creating a game app from nothing and wanted to make something unique other cohorts hadn't tried before. It was a chance for us to combine our creativity with the skills we have developed over the last 12 weeks at Makers!

## What Did We Learn?

Initially, we wanted to use the MERN stack for our project. However after serious issues getting the project up and running, we took a step back and realised that we were overcomplicating things. We learnt that it is important to start small and not overwhelm ourselves from the beginning.

Learning to use react and JSX was a huge undertaking in such a short amount of time. We overcame this by reaching out to coaches, self-led learning and a lot of Googling!  

## What Makes Our Project Stand Out?

It's unique, all the assets and code in our project are original and created by each and every team member. 

We are especially thankful to Camilla & Mas for creating all of our image assets which gives our game it's unique look!
